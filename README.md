# The iCub event-driven Project

Libraries that handle neuromorphic sensors, such as the dynamic vision sensor, installed on the iCub can be found here, along with algorithms to process the event-based data. Examples include, optical flow, corner detection and ball detection. Demo applications for controlling the robot based on event input are also found here.

## How to Install:

1. Install YARP: http://wiki.icub.org/wiki/Linux:Installation_from_sources
1. If the iCub is being used install icub-main and icub-contrib-common following the instructions for YARP. It is possible to run event-driven without iCub install however some modules cannot be used and will not be installed.
1. Clone event-driven and build as a icub-contrib-module if using the iCub environment, or manually if not (YARP is still required)
